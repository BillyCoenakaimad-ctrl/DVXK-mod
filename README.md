UPDATE: 1.2: I THOUGHT THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT FOR THIS PROJECT, FIGURED OUT THERE IS STILL, SINCE THIS IS WHAT I MIGHT WANT TO CALL FIGHTING A GHOST MACHINE. FROM NOW ON THIS PROJECT WILL ONLY FOCUS ON FIXING RESIDENT EVIL REVELATIONS 2.

HOW TO USE (please read carefully): FIRST, RIGHT CLICK REV2.EXE, GO TO PROPERTIES, COMPATIBILITY AND THEN CHECK "Disable fullscreen optimizations" AND "RUN THIS PROGRAM AS AN ADMINISTRATOR" then click APPLY, AFTER THAT, COPY AND PAST THE DLL AND CONF FILES TO YOUR GAME FOLDER (where the RE REV2.exe exists). READ BELOW.

 COMMON ISSUES:

 #IF THE GAME DOESN'T LAU?CH AFTER INSTALLING THE MOD, IT'S MOST CERTAINLY A COMPATIBILITY ISSUE, IT'S PROBABLY YOUR GPU DRIVERS BEING INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE DXVK RELEASE. TO SOLVE THIS YOU SHOULD TRY TO FIND A DXVK RELEASE THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH YOUR GPU DRIVERS, IT SHOULD BE BETWEEN 1.5 (this is where directx9 STARTED GETTING SUPPORTED) AND THE LATEST VERSION 2.7.1.

#THE MOD SIMPLY NOT MAKING ANY CHANGES: YOU SHOULD ALWAYS MAKE SURE THE GAME IS USING OUR DX9 AND THEREFORE THE MODIFICATIONS, ONE OF THE SIGNS ARE THE GAME CREATING A FILE NAMED "rerev2.dxvk-cache" or "rerev2_d3d9.log", ONE OF THE REASONS WHY YOU MIGHT FALL INTO THIS IS NOT USING THE x32 VERSION OF DXVK, IN CASE YOU ARE FACING THE DRIVERS COMPATIBILITY ISSUE AND YOU WANTED TO USE A DIFFERENT RELEASE MAKE SURE YOU PICK THE FILES FROM x32, RE REV 2 IS A 32 BIT GAME.

PS: Feel free to report your issues.
