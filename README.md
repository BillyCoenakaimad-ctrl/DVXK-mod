NOTICE: I WAS ABLE OF REPRODUCING THE ISSUE ON A LOW-END PC BY CONFIGURING THE "config.ini". THEREFORE, THE SOLUTION WILL BE MORE COMPLICATED,AND INSTEAD OF USING THE DXVK AS A PATH I WILL COMPILE AN INDEPENDENT DLL FILE, IT WILL SERVE AS A LAYER BETWEEN MT FRAMEWORK ENGINE AND THE WINDOWS 10'S WDDM, MAYBE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO FIX THIS... I WILL STOP WORKING ON THIS FIX FOR NOW AS I AM BUSY WITH OTHER THINGS, BUT I WILL CERTAINLY BE BACK TO FINISH WHAT I STARTED.

UPDATE: 1.2: I THOUGHT THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT FOR THIS PROJECT, FIGURED OUT THERE IS STILL, SINCE THIS IS WHAT I MIGHT WANT TO CALL FIGHTING A GHOST MACHINE. FROM NOW ON THIS PROJECT WILL ONLY FOCUS ON FIXING RESIDENT EVIL REVELATIONS 2.

HOW TO USE (please read carefully): FIRST, RIGHT CLICK REV2.EXE, GO TO PROPERTIES, COMPATIBILITY AND THEN CHECK "Disable fullscreen optimizations" AND "RUN THIS PROGRAM AS AN ADMINISTRATOR" then click APPLY, AFTER THAT, COPY AND PAST THE DLL AND CONF FILES TO YOUR GAME FOLDER (where the RE REV2.exe exists), AFTER THAT YOU SHOULD COPY THE CONFIG.INI FILE INTO THE FOLDER WHERE YOUR CONFIGURATION IS GETTING SAVED, IT'S USUALLY C:\Users\<YOURUSERNAME>\AppData\Local\CAPCOM\RESIDENT EVIL REVELATIONS2 WITH C:\ BEING THE SYSTEM FILES DRIVE. READ BELOW.

 COMMON ISSUES:

 #IF THE GAME DOESN'T LAUNCH AFTER INSTALLING THE MOD, IT'S MOST CERTAINLY A COMPATIBILITY ISSUE, IT'S PROBABLY YOUR GPU DRIVERS BEING INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE DXVK RELEASE. TO SOLVE THIS YOU SHOULD TRY TO FIRST UPDATE YOUR GRAPHICS CARD DRIVERS, AND IF THIS DIDN'T SEEM TO HELP? YOU SHOULD TRY TO FIND A DXVK RELEASE THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH YOUR GPU DRIVERS (YOU ARE GOING TO NEED ONLY THE "d3d9.dll" AND "dxgi.dll"FROM THE 32 bit FOLDER AND MY "dxvk.conf" file, IT SHOULD BE BETWEEN 1.5 (this is where directx9 STARTED GAINING SUPPORT) AND THE LATEST VERSION 2.7.1. I ADVISE YOU TO CHECK THE OLDER VERSIONS FIRS STARTING FROM 1.10 UNTIL YOU REACH 1.5, AND THEN TRY THE LATEST ONE ONLY, IF THIS DIDN't WORK, I'M SORRY, YOU DRIVERS ARE JUST TOO OLD.

#THE MOD SIMPLY NOT MAKING ANY CHANGES: YOU SHOULD ALWAYS MAKE SURE THE GAME IS USING OUR DX9 AND THEREFORE THE MODIFICATIONS, ONE OF THE SIGNS ARE THE GAME CREATING A FILE NAMED "rerev2.dxvk-cache" or "rerev2_d3d9.log", ONE OF THE REASONS WHY YOU MIGHT FALL INTO THIS IS NOT USING THE x32 VERSION OF DXVK, IN CASE YOU ARE FACING THE DRIVERS COMPATIBILITY ISSUE AND YOU WANTED TO USE A DIFFERENT RELEASE MAKE SURE YOU PICK THE FILES FROM x32, RE REV 2 IS A 32 BIT GAME.

PS: Feel free to report your issues.
